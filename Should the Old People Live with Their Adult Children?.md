# Should the Old People Live with Their Adult Children?

Nowadays there are some people arguing about whether old people should live with their
adult children or not, which, from my perspective, is unquestioned in China. How should
the old live apart from their adult children?

I have to admit that many old people actually do live separately for several reasons,
yet nevertheless, if condition permits, it will be a better choice to live together.
On the one hand, in China, loneliness has been a big problem for senior citizens for
a long time. Without children's company, it's shown that elderly people are more
likely to develop mental problems and diseases. On the other hand, young people are
busier and busier at present. Thus their old parents can help them out with some
simple but time-consuming chores. Besides, some appropriate amounts of physical
labor are beneficial to old people in the meanwhile.

To draw a conclusion, living with children should be considered as a better option
as long as it's possible due to the advantages it brings for both the senior citizens
and their adult children.
